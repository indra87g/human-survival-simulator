# Developer Guide

Hi, friend!
Do you want to develop your own implementation of HSS?
This developer guide will suitable for you.

## Getting Started
Ok. without wasting our time, lets start!
Before we start, we need to decide the way to develop:

- Using HSS CLI source code
- Using PyHSS library (coming soon)
- Using REST API (coming soon)

### Using HSS CLI source code
This is the recommended way to develop "your own" HSS. But you must
clean the code manually to help you for developing.

Lets try this way!
